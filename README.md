# Twitter Bootswatch Rails gem
  
  - Integrates Twitter Bootstrap CSS & Font Awesome toolkit into the Rails 3.1+ Asset Pipeline
  - Easy control over which javascript and less modules are loaded by default. Not every app needs a carousel
  - Simple default less files for custom application themes ("[theme_name]/variables.less" and "[theme_name]/bootswatch.less")
  - Easily apply different custom themes or bootswatches from a site like [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/)
  - Create several themed swatches for your project with theme_names, (e.g. an admin theme and a storefront theme using namespaced theme_names)
  - Gem version semantics extend Twitter Bootstrap version semantics, making it simple to know what version of bootstrap the gem is using

## Includes Twitter Bootstrap for Rails 3.1+ Asset Pipeline
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites. It includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more.

## Includes Font Awesome for Rails 3.1+ Asset Pipeline
[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome) is a toolkit with iconic fonts designed for use with Twitter Bootstrap.


```css
/*
 *= require_self
 *= require [theme_name]/loader
 *= require font-awesome/font-awesome
*/
```

If you need the ie7 fix:

```css
/*
 *= require_self
 *= require [theme_name]/loader
 *= require font-awesome/font-awesome-ie7
*/
```

## Demo

The [demo](https://github.com/scottvrosenthal/twitter-bootswatch-rails-demo) will show you how this gem can be used in a rails 3.1+ application.

## View Helpers
The gem [twitter-bootswatch-rails-helpers](https://github.com/scottvrosenthal/twitter-bootswatch-rails-helpers) provides rails view helpers for twitter bootstrap's breadcrumbs and alerts components.


## Install

Include the [Twitter Bootswatch Rails gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/twitter-bootswatch-rails) in Gemfile to install it from [RubyGems.org](http://rubygems.org):

```ruby
group :assets do
  # rails default gems
  ...

  # just put after rails asset defaults
  gem 'twitter-bootswatch-rails', '~= 2.3.1.2'

end

# View Helpers Gem can go outside the assets group
gem 'twitter-bootswatch-rails-helpers', '>= 2.3.1'
```

or you can install from latest build;

```ruby
gem 'twitter-bootswatch-rails', :git => 'git://github.com/scottvrosenthal/twitter-bootswatch-rails.git'
```

Run bundle from command line

    bundle


## Installing to App (using Generators)

You can run the following generators to get started with Twitter Bootstrap & Font Awesome quickly.


If you don't provide a [theme_name] the value defaults to **bootswatch** and adds directives to your application.css and application.js files.


Usage:


    rails g bootswatch:install [theme_name]

Example:


    rails g bootswatch:install admin
    rails g bootswatch:install storefront

***

Layout (generates a basic Twitter Bootstrap compatible layout) - ([haml-rails](https://github.com/indirect/haml-rails) gem supported)


Usage:


    rails g bootswatch:layout [theme_name]


Example:


    rails g bootswatch:layout admin
    rails g bootswatch:layout storefront

***

Themed (generates Twitter Bootstrap compatible scaffold views.) - ([simple_form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) and [haml-rails](https://github.com/indirect/haml-rails) gems supported)


Usage (model and table must already exist):


    rails g bootswatch:themed [RESOURCE_NAME]


Example:


    rails g scaffold Post title:string description:text
    rake db:migrate
    rails g bootswatch:themed Posts

## Import a free [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/) theme

*(only available with twitter-bootswatch-rails v2.3.1.2+)*

### Just follow these three steps in the following order :)

    rails g bootswatch:install cyborg
    rails g bootswatch:import cyborg
    rails g bootswatch:layout cyborg

The above creates a namespaced theme under assets/javascript/cyborg assets/stylesheets/cyborg and a new layout file.

The import generator pulls directly from the [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/) git repo [cyborg](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/tree/gh-pages/cyborg) directory.

* bootswatch.less
* variables.less

In your rails controllers just tell it to use the cyborg layout.

    layout: 'cyborg'

You can also create an admin namespaced theme and import the cyborg bootswatch.less and variable.less files:

    rails g bootswatch:install admin
    rails g bootswatch:import admin/cyborg
    rails g bootswatch:layout admin

Need more examples? Check out the [demo](https://github.com/scottvrosenthal/twitter-bootswatch-rails-demo)

## Using stylesheets with the [less-rails](https://github.com/metaskills/less-rails/) gem

You have to require "[theme_name]/loader.css.less" in your application.css

```css
/*
 *= require_self
 *= require [theme_name]/loader
 *= require font-awesome/font-awesome
*/
```

"[theme_name]/loader.css.less" allows you to easily comment out less modules you don't need in your application.

For instance, as per the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/scaffolding.html#responsive) project we don't include the responsive styles by default. Uncomment `@import "twitter/bootstrap/responsive";` in "[theme_name]/loader.css.less" to enable it.

"[theme_name]/variables.less" customize Twitter Bootstrap "variables.less" defaults in this file.

"[theme_name]/bootswatch.less" customize the style of Twitter Bootstrap base css and component style here.

Check out some of the swatches at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/)

Read up on the [less-rails](https://github.com/metaskills/less-rails/) gem.

***

#### base.less

When importing a custom bootswatch.less file manually you'll need to include the following import directive at the top of the file:

```css
@import "base";
```

The import base.less directive allows the importing less file to access and override inherited less variables.

Example:

```css
@import "base";
// Cyborg 2.3.1
// bootswatch.less
```

## Using Javascripts

You have to require the coffeescript file "[theme_name]/loader.coffee" in your application.js:

```javascript
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require [theme_name]/loader
```

"[theme_name]/loader.coffee" allows you to easily comment out modules you don't need in your application:

```coffee
# [theme_name]/loader.coffee

#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-transition
#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-alert
#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-button
#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-carousel
#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-collapse
#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-dropdown
#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-modal
#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-tooltip
#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-popover
#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-scrollspy
#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-tab
#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-typeahead
#= require twitter/bootstrap/bootstrap-affix


#= require [theme_name]/bootswatch
```

"[theme_name]/bootswatch.coffee" allows you to easily add swatch customization to javascript modules loaded:

Check out some of the swatches at [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/)

### Responsive styling?
As per the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/scaffolding.html#responsive) project we don't include the responsive styles by default. Uncomment `@import "twitter/bootstrap/responsive";` in "[theme_name]/loader.css.less" to enable it.

### Local rails development assets not updating?

```sh
RAILS_ENV=development rake assets:clean
```

## Versioning
Bootstrap [claims](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap#versioning) to use SemVer, although this is for values of public API that don't seem to include selectively requiring CSS components (see breaking change 2.0.4 -> 2.1.0). Since many people using bootstrap-swatch-rails *do* selectively require CSS components and I consider it part of the public API we can't really follow SemVer without becoming wildly out of sync with the Bootstrap version number, which is confusing for everyone involved. Further releases to bootstrap-swatch-rails will therefore have version numbers of the form `2.x.x.y`, where `2.x.x` is the release of Bootstrap we should be compatible with, and `y` is the patch version.
